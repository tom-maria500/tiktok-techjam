 we need to set up a few more meetings related to the advertising team
 and then we'll work on
 Project deadlines and
 it is I just don't know how to test that
 okay this is the different actions
 based on the discussion
 hello
 sorry
 upload
 feedback
 okay so this is after stop
 is I'm not gonna you don't have to stop recording
 because it still doesn't read like even if I don't
 stop okay the problem is it's like
 it doesn't delete it from the last 1 because I'm not making a new file everything good so I have to do it so when you stop recording like usually stop the recording at the end of the meeting and then
 save it to a file of all the client
 if you put that file up
 I don't want it to be like that because then in the meeting minutes
 um it has to use
 okay yeah that's specific meeting to generate the meeting
 minutes to the current
 okay
 but then this okay
